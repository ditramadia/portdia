  overview: [
    "Over summer of 2022, I volunteered as head of website development for IMPACT Metanoia. I worked with six other developers, pitching ideas regularly to the supervisor, Alisha Alistya.",
    "Some things I learned from this project were to manage software project development cycle with extra details and lots of planning. Assigning tasks should be carefully planned out to maximize the use of agile methodologies, creating a parallel working environment, thus speeding up the process. Communication is also a great factor, I learned to be understanding and motivating, so the work can be done more efficiently.",
