  summary: "Toco Language Learning App",
  description: "Language learning platform with four microservices",
  overview: [
    "While taking web based application development course, we had an opportunity to create a multi-service web app. The mission was to make a web app that has a client-side application, admin application, and a secured transaction system. We decided to create a language learning app where users can choose a variety of languages and then work through a series of video lessons and exercises to improve their vocabulary, phrases, grammar, and pronunciation. Users can track their progress over time. Admins are able to create courses, upload new video, create exercises, manage merchandise, and voucher codes. The transaction system uses gems as the currency and they are used to buy merchandises. We use a soap service to secure the transactions and communication between services.",
