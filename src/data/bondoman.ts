  overview: [
    "While taking Platform-Based Application Development course, we learned to make an android app using kotlin. The project was to make a wallet app that tracks user income and expenses. It can also scan payment bills using a dummy OCR and generate transactions automatically. We also provided statistics view for the user to view their transactions overview.",
    "I worked on the design using Figma to create a modern and minimalistic design. I also worked on front-end development, mainly on layouts, implementing the design into a mobile app."
